BLOCK: Funding & Liquidity

#description
I started at Block in September 2020, a few months after the COVID-19 pandemic emptied out the office in the heart of SOHO.

I spent three years working for the Funding and Liquidity team at Square Banking. We made sure that if you took out a Square loan, you got your money, and if you were investing in those loans you got your interest in time too. In practice it was a bit more complicated, and I spent a lot of time learning in depth how to translate the worlds of accounting and money into computer code.

Hightlights of my time at Block include

- Building out a series of reports to guarantee correctness of money movements between Square, our internal bank (Square Financial Services), borrowers and external investors.
- Enabling borrowers to have their loans deposited directly into their internal Square account and not just an external bank account.
- Winning the Fall 2022 hackathon with a proof-of-concept on using blockchain technology to make instant international payments for a fraction of the cost and exchange rate risk.
